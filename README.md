# nbased
This is a [Naranja](https://www.naranja.com/) adaptation of the [ebased](https://github.com/AndresSomadossi/ebased) library written by Andres Somadossi.

## What is nbased?
nbased is a fork of ebased that allow us to bring features quickly and mostly required by our company, Naranja.<br><br>
Ebased (comes from event-based) is a library that simplifies the input/output as well as the downstream calls of your lambda functions. The idea behind it is that, no matter what event triggers your lambda, you should be able to write your logic in a generic way.

## What is not?
Ebased is not a framework. We wont tell you where to put your code, or how to do it. We just give you the tools to do it in a painless way and you can use every or just a few things.
